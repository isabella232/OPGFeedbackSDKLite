### Surveys

Surveys offer a great opportunity to get input from your target market. OPGFeedbackSDK provides an easy way to integrate survey capability into your iOS mobile apps. Using the OnePoint Global Question Editor or Studio, you can build custom surveys to suit any need.

### Themes
OPGFeedbackSDK provides developers the ability to create a coherent color theme throughout their entire application, removing the need to mess with the dozens of UIAppearance proxies for each UI component.


### Media
OPGSDKFeedback allows the respondents take media questions within a survey enabling them to easily upload images, videos and audio responses.

### Location
OPGFeedbackSDK lets you take advantage of built-in GPS units in mobile phones to conduct location based surveys. These surveys can made to popup on respondent's smartphones when they enter/exit a survey location like Walmart, Starbucks or an entertainment venue.

### Social
Social Login seamlessly integrates with your existing social media accounts. Having it registered with our OnePoint Admin suite, you can take surveys by authenticating using your social media accounts. OPGFeedbackSDK supports Google and Facebook networks.
